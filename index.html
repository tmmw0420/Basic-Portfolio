<!--Homework 
	1.  The content for the index.html should be unique to you.
	2. Write a paragraph or two about yourself. Make it fun, show your personality!
	3. The main logo where it says "Your Name" should say your name. This may make the logo section smaller or wider depending on how long your name is, that is fine and expected.Add, commit, and push your code to GitHub often, especially when you complete a page. -->

			This is where I need to write my bio.  First let me introduce myself: Tatiana Wilcox, wife, mother and life long student. I have a lot to learn and will never stop.
			I would for a Fortune 500 company and while I enjoy what I do, I know there is something out ther waiting for me to excel in.
